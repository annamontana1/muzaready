PROJECT: Orders Admin Panel Frontend Implementation
BRANCH: feature/orders-api
ASSESSMENT: Actual vs Reported Status

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

REPORTED STATUS:  100% COMPLETE ✅
ACTUAL STATUS:    25-30% COMPLETE ❌

DISCREPANCY:      75% OVERSTATED

================================================================================
WHAT'S ACTUALLY DONE (25-30%)
================================================================================

BACKEND API:          100% ✅
  - 7 fully working API routes
  - Filtering, sorting, pagination implemented
  - Payment capture, shipment creation working
  - Bulk operations implemented
  
BASIC PAGES:          25% ✅
  - /objednavky (list with table)
  - /objednavky/[id] (detail view)
  - /objednavky/[id]/edit (edit form - INCOMPLETE)

AUTH:                 100% ✅
  - Admin middleware protection
  - Session management

================================================================================
CRITICAL MISSING PIECES (75%)
================================================================================

1. FILTERS COMPONENT
   Status: 0% - DOES NOT EXIST
   Impact: List page completely unfilterable
   Time to fix: 2 hours

2. PAGINATION COMPONENT
   Status: 0% - DOES NOT EXIST
   Impact: Can only see first 50 orders, no navigation
   Time to fix: 1.5 hours

3. SORTING
   Status: 0% - NOT IMPLEMENTED
   Impact: Cannot sort orders by any column
   Time to fix: 1 hour

4. PAYMENT CAPTURE MODAL
   Status: 0% - DOES NOT EXIST
   Impact: Cannot record payments
   Time to fix: 1.5 hours

5. SHIPMENT MODAL
   Status: 0% - DOES NOT EXIST
   Impact: Cannot create shipments
   Time to fix: 2 hours

6. BULK ACTIONS
   Status: 0% - DOES NOT EXIST
   Impact: Cannot perform bulk updates
   Time to fix: 1.5 hours

7. EDIT FORM - INCOMPLETE
   Status: 20% - Only orderStatus field exists
   Missing: paymentStatus, deliveryStatus, tags, notes, riskScore
   Time to fix: 1.75 hours

8. UI COMPONENTS LIBRARY
   Status: 0% - ALL MISSING
   Missing: StatusBadge, PaginationControls, ConfirmDialog,
            LoadingSpinner, ErrorAlert, FilterDropdown
   Time to fix: 3 hours

================================================================================
TIME & RESOURCE ESTIMATE
================================================================================

Remaining work: ~19-20 hours

If 1 developer:    2.5-3 weeks
If 2 developers:   1-1.5 weeks  
If 3 developers:   3-4 days

CANNOT MERGE without completing:
  • Filters + Pagination (makes panel unusable without these)
  • Edit form completion
  • At least one modal (Payment OR Shipment)

================================================================================
WHY THE DISCREPANCY?
================================================================================

THEORY 1: Backend vs Frontend Confusion
  Likely: Backend API is genuinely 100% complete
  Error: Someone reported backend status as frontend

THEORY 2: Wishlist vs Reality
  Likely: FRONTEND_TASKS.md describes components in detail
  Error: Files don't exist, looked like "done" but were just planned

THEORY 3: Incomplete Tasks Marked Done
  Likely: Individual page files exist (page.tsx, [id]/page.tsx, edit/page.tsx)
  Error: "Pages exist" was counted as "task complete"
  Reality: Without filters/pagination/modals, pages are unusable

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

1. DO NOT MERGE to main in current state
   → Panel is not functional without filters/pagination

2. PRIORITY ORDER:
   a) Implement filters & pagination (4.5 hours) - BLOCKER
   b) Complete edit form (1.75 hours) - BLOCKER  
   c) Add payment capture modal (1.5 hours) - HIGH
   d) Add shipment modal (2 hours) - HIGH
   e) Bulk actions (1.5 hours) - MEDIUM

3. REALISTIC TIMELINE:
   → Need minimum 10-12 hours of focused development
   → Expected completion: 2-3 working days (if uninterrupted)

4. QUALITY GATE:
   ✓ Before merge, all these MUST work:
     - Filter by all status types
     - Paginate through orders
     - Sort orders
     - Edit all order fields
     - Capture payment
     - Create shipment
     - Bulk update orders

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The backend API is production-ready and comprehensive. However, the frontend
is in early stages (25-30%) and lacks critical UI components needed for a
functional admin panel.

The 100% complete rating appears to be either:
  a) An audit of backend only, or
  b) Counting API routes as "frontend complete"

Current state is essentially "read-only CRUD" not an "admin panel".

Recommend immediate course correction and realistic timeline adjustment.
